# Git vs GitHub

## Git

Git is a distributed version control system that empowers developers to track changes in their code efficiently. It operates through the command line, enabling seamless collaboration and synchronization of code revisions among team members. One notable feature is its ability to work offline without the need for a centralized server.

## GitHub

GitHub is a web-based platform that harnesses the power of Git for collaborative software development. Serving as a hosting service, GitHub enhances the Git experience with a user-friendly graphical interface. This platform facilitates code hosting, project management, collaborative coding, and issue tracking. It acts as a centralized hub for storing, sharing, and collaborating on code, making teamwork more accessible and efficient.
